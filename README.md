## 🌟 Our Mission

> *"Homelessness is not inevitable. With the right support, people... come back."*

We combine housing stability with environmental stewardship, creating rural communities where both people and the earth can heal and thrive together.

## 🏡 What We Do

### The Constellation Project
A phased, dignity-first system that moves people from immediate survival to long-term stability:

1. **Emergency Stabilization** — Immediate access to food, shelter, and safety
2. **Transitional Support** — Building skills through land stewardship and community participation
3. **Permanent Housing** — Low-impact, dignified housing integrated into restored landscapes
4. **Sustained Purpose** — Long-term stability through meaningful work and community bonds

### Rural Land Restoration
Our Michigan-based project integrates housing with ecological rehabilitation:
- Native vegetation planting
- Pollinator habitat creation
- Soil regeneration & erosion control
- Wildlife-friendly corridors
- Community food production
